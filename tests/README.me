# Greenpeace.org Testsuitei

This sections contains the testsuite to test all greenpeace.org sites. The folder GP-All contains the tests that apply to the vanilla GP site (GPI) and additional folders should be created to include tests that apply only to a specific NRO. 

i.e. GP-NL folder should be created to include tests that apply only to Greenpeace Netherlands site. 

Tests use tags to indicate their NRO, capability and feature they apply to. This makes possible to execute different tests that meet a specific scope by using group unions and exclusions.
 
### How to run test groups
To add a test to a specifc group just add a comment before the test function including a @ tag and the group name like this:
  
    /**
     * @group gpi
     */ 

To execute only tests that correspond to a specific group then add "--group" followed by the group name at the end of the command to execute the tests. The command to run the tests of a specific group called gpi will look like this:

	vendor/bin/phpunit -c tests/ --group gpi;

To exclude a group of tests to be run in the tests execution then add a "--exclude-group" followed by the group name at the end of the command. The command to run the tests excluding a specific group called gpi will look like this:
	
	vendor/bin/phpunit -c tests/ --exclude-group gpi;
